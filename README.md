# LSM3241 Genomic Data Analysis Project 1 - Rstudio
Group Project: Identification of miR-203-driven Transcriptomic Changes during Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in a Breast Cancer Model
## Objective
Find out how miR-203 causes cancer via performing differential gene expression analysis to identify 
the key genes that are regulated by miR-203. Analysis of gene pathways can be analysed to further 
understand the development of breast cancer.
## Programs 
1. Rstudio
2. Libraries: bioconductor, knitr
3. Packages: GEOquery
## How to use?
1. Download raw data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the 12 .gz extension file provided
2. Follow steps from CA1 code.R with results provided in LSM3241 CA1 Rcode with Results.pdf to crosscheck
3. Final set of genes causing breast cancer provided in recommendations.csv
3. Refer to final report analysis for detailed documentation of findings
